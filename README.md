# PCTO2024
This repository contains all of the code, examples and sketches used during our GameAbility Unity project.


## TEAM
Our team is composed of 4 ITIS students from Cuneo, Italy.

## Simone Arrigoni
**Simone Arrigoni** is the group leader and manager, he had the most impact on the project because he tried his hardest to get to know as much as possible about **Microsoft Hololens 2** and, thanks to **Leonardo Pollicino**, he managed to transfer the **Unity** projects into **Hololens 2**

## Leonardo Pollicino
**Leonardo Pollicino** had the most impact regarding the implementation of **Unity** in **Hololens 2**, he has also looked into the **C#** programming language to help **Karol Bruno** and **Marco Masoero** scripting the **GameObjects**.

## Marco Masoero
**Marco Masoero** has contributed in the **C# scripting** and especially in the process of **brainstorming**, because coming up with doable ideas is absolutely crucial, considering the one and a half week deadline.

## Karol Bruno
**Karol Bruno**'s role in the team was converting all of the ideas into code, assigning the **scripts** to the **GameObjects**, and doing research on the coding language **C#**. 
Inevitably, he has also looked into how **Unity** works and gave a contribute to the project.
